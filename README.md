# SoftwareRenderer
A simple educational software renderer. May it serve you well.

## Features
* line and triangle rasterization
* triangle clipping
* texturing
* render textures
* z-buffer
* vertex/fragment shaders

## What's missing
* backface culling
* proper .obj loader (there's a barebones one in ExternalFigure)

## Dependencies
* JOML for matrix operations.

Godspeed.
